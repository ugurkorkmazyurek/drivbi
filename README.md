Drivbi is extremely simple and user-friendly. Each vehicle owner receives Drivbi stickers as part of their vehicle and affixes them to their vehicle. These stickers support both QR code and NFC technology.

1. **Communication with QR Code**: When a person wants to communicate with the vehicle owner, they scan the QR code on the Drivbi sticker with their phone's camera. The person scanning the QR code can send a message to the car owner or leave a contact request.\

2. **Communication with NFC**: NFC-enabled phones can communicate with the car owner by bringing them close to the Drivbi sticker. This automatically sends contact information or a predetermined message to the car owner's phone.
